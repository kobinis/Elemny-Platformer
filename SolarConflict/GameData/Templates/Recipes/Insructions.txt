Amount Produced (number) – How many items of this type will be created.

Cost1… (text and number* and boolean*) - Which materials are needed to create the item. 
We can add as many materials as we want. 
For each material we add needed amount of this material (no fractions) .
If we don't  mention the amount. the amount will be calculate automatically based on the item price.
BE CAREFULL - do not create expansive items that can be created by cheap martials, this will allow the player to create infinite money.

Example: key item need key mold to create it, the key mold item will be marked as false because the key mold won't be consumed when we create the key

Every material need to end with the suffix "item"
