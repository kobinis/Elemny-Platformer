Weapon  template instructions:
===========================
Description – For each weapon we need to define which shots he will shot.
Different weapons can shoot the same shots.


Columns:

Cooldown* (number) – Cooldown between each shot (in frames) 

Inner Cooldown – if the weapon shoot some shots on the same fire action, we might want that each shot will be fired one after the other. If this is the case the Inner Cooldown is the interval between each shot.
