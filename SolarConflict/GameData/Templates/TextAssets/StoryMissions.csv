At one end, a central command station is present with additional squads. All ships that enter the system are examined by security before moving to their business. \nScanning the Command Station reveals several complex energy readings not commonly found in other stations. It is hard to fully determine the nature of it, but these may be defensive countermeasures and fail-safes. There is a good chance destroying this will not only disable communications but disable all ships in the system. The release of this energy mixed with the other countermeasures would potentially stop most ships from functioning in this system for days if they are not outright destroyed. Our ship's shield technology can most certainly guard against these effects, allowing us to their measures to our advantage.",,"Command station has a lot of experiments in particular here. Experiments to disable ships, and influence warp travel. When destroyed, this stuff shuts down the entire system for travel completely. Also leaves behind stuff to stop travel as well. When this combines with the super nova, this creates a portal to the other side of the galaxy. Could be related to the similar experiments to the mothership.
